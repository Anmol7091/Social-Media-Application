# Social-Media-Application
Social Media Web App is built with React 19 and Vite, designed to provide a fast and responsive user experience. It allows users to create posts with titles, body content, reactions, and hashtags, which are then dynamically displayed in a structured post list using the React Context API for state management. The UI is styled with Bootstrap 5 and enhanced with React Icons, ensuring a clean and mobile-friendly design. The app follows a modular component-based architecture with reusable parts like CreatePost, PostList, and Footer, making it scalable and easy to extend.
